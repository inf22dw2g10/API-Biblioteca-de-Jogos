# Games Library

Repository to host the project developed for Web Development 2, a 2nd year subject at UMAIA. Developed by Group 4 : [@DinisXimenes](https://github.com/xmenzzz), [@PedroRamos](https://github.com/senou6), [@TiagoPereira](https://github.com/tiagopraca) .

## Short theme description

In this project we intend to create a library for games. Something similar to the Library on the App Steam. It will let you add your games to your own library from a database of different games. The user will also be able to comment once per game in a specific section added to the library where they will be able to evaluate the game as they want.
